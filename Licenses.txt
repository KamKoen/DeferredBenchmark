Sponza Model

Description taken from the download page:

"August 19, 2010
The Atrium Sponza Palace, Dubrovnik, is an elegant and improved model created by Frank Meinl. 
The original Sponza model was created by Marko Dabrovic in early 2002. Over the years, the 
Sponza Atrium scene has become one of the most popular 3D scenes for testing global illumination 
and radiosity due to it's specific architectural structure which is particularly complex for global 
illumination light.

However, nowadays it is considered as a simple model, thus it was decided to crate a new model with 
highly improved appearance and scene complexity. It is donated to the public for  radiosity and is 
represented in several different formats (3ds, Obj) for use with various commercial 3D applications 
and renderers."
